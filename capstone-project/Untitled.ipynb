    "### Snowflake Schema based model:\n",
    "With this project, I wanted to find the effect of temperature on the number of passengers arriving at a port. The data we had were:\n",
    "1. Dim table #1 (port_location): The mapping of port to the country/city it is located in. It is created from i94port_valid.txt file where only valid i94port location details are extracted. \n",
    "2. Dim table #2 (dim_temp): The average monthly temperature of a country/city for a given month and year. It is extracted from global temperature data.\n",
    "3. Dim table #3 (dim_immigration): The count of passengers arriving at (and departing from) a port in a given year/month. It is extracted from I94 immigration data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These had some commonalities using which we could obtain the desired outcome. I chose to do it in two steps:\n",
    "1. Create another dim table (avg_temp) by joining port_location (Dim table #1) and dim_temp (Dim table #2) based on the fields *city* and *country*. This would thus provide the average monthly temperature at a port for a given year and month.\n",
    "2. Join the dim table from above with dim_immigration (Dim table #3) using port, year and month to get the desired outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the reason behind choosing Snowkflake Schema, I chose it because:\n",
    "* We needed to create an intermediate dim_table.\n",
    "* Snowflake can avoid redundant data which makes it easier to maintain.\n",
    "* Snowflake schema leads to reduced data redundancy and consumes lesser disk space."
